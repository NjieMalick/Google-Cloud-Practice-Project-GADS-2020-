Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with App Engine

Overview

In this lab, you create and deploy a simple App Engine application using a virtual environment in the Google Cloud Shell.

Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

1. Initialize App Engine.

2. Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.

3. Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.

4. Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.

##########Task 1 Initialize App Engine.###########

## step 1 
Activate Google Cloud Shell

In GCP console, on the top right toolbar, click the Open Cloud Shell button

Click Continue.

You can list the active account name with this command:

$ gcloud auth list

You can list the project ID with this command:

$ gcloud config list project

## step 2
Initialize your App Engine app with your project and choose its region:

$ gcloud app create --project=$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID

## step 3
Clone the source code repository for a sample application in the hello_world directory

$ git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples

##step 4
Navigate to the source directory:

cd python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world


###########Task 2 Preview an App Engine application running locally in Cloud Shell.###########

##step 1
Execute the following command to download and update the packages list.

$ sudo apt-get update

##step 2
Set up a virtual environment in which you will run your application. Python virtual environments are used to isolate package installations from the system.

$ sudo apt-get install virtualenv

or

$ virtualenv -p python3 venv

##step 3
Activate the virtual environment.

$ source venv/bin/activate

##step 4
Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies.

$ pip install  -r requirements.txt

##step 5
Run the application:

$ python main.py

##step 6
In Cloud Shell, click Web preview (Web Preview) > Preview on port 8080 to preview the application.

##step 7
To end the test, return to Cloud Shell and press Ctrl+C to abort the deployed service.


########## Task 3 Deploy an App Engine application, so that others can reach it.############

To deploy your application to the App Engine Standard environment

##step 1
Navigate to the source directory:

$ cd ~/python-docs-samples/appengine/standard_python3/hello_world

##step 2
Deploy your Hello World application.

$gcloud app deploy

If prompted "Do you want to continue (Y/n)?", press Y and then Enter.

##step 3
Launch your browser to view the app at

$ gcloud app browse

Copy and paste the URL into a new browser window.


########Task 4 Disable an App Engine application, when you no longer want it to be visible.##########

##step 1

In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu, click App Engine > Settings.

##step 2

Click Disable application.

##step 3

Read the dialog message. Enter the App ID and click DISABLE.
